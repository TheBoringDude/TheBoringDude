### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student  and is currently exploring the programming world. 

I am a beginner and a newbie programmer.

I code but I have no money, so I rely on free services.

**Due to my current situation, what do I commonly do?**
- Code **scraper** APIs and deploy them on serverless platforms.
- Design some websites, if I want to.
- Make the app that I want to have.
- Learn NEW Frameworks and Programming Languages
